"""
Assigns each team a Local TV Deal -- a per-team regional broadcast
contract, separate from and additional to the league-wide national TV
deal in data/deals.json -> tv_deal_formula. Modeled on how real clubs
carry both a shared national media-rights split AND their own
individual local/regional broadcast deal that varies hugely by market
size (a big-market club's local deal dwarfs a small-market club's).

Run ONCE, right after Draft Day, same timing rule as
generate_schedule.py -- market tier is a fixed, season-long assignment
(like a real regional broadcast contract), not renegotiated mid-season.

Every team gets exactly one of five market tiers, split as evenly as
possible across the league and drawn reproducibly from season_seed (same
principle as match simulation: any assignment can be independently
re-verified after the fact). The dollar amount is paid out at the same
midseason split point as the national TV deal (after Round 3 of a
19-round season -- see tv_deal_formula.midseason_split_timing) with a
Star Power modifier: local broadcasters pay more for star wattage in
their own market, same logic as the national deal's star bonus, scaled
proportionally instead of as a flat add since local bases already vary
so much by tier.
