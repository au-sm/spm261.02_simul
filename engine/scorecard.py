Season Scorecard -- the season-long scorecard for the SM Owners League.

100 points, four components, each answering a different question about
how the season went for that owner:

  RANKING     40 pts  "Did your team win?"            -- regular-season standings
  PLAYOFFS     5 pts  "Did you make the playoffs?"     -- flat bonus for finishing inside
                                                           the qualification line (no
                                                           bracket games are played)
  REVENUE     35 pts  "Did you run it as a business?"  -- ticket + sponsorship + national
                                                           TV + local TV revenue generated,
                                                           ranked against the rest of the league
  RATIONALE   20 pts  "Could you explain your calls?"  -- average score on the weekly
                                                           Decision Rationale Rubric

RANKING and REVENUE are both scored by LINEAR RANK within the league
(1st = full points, last = 0, evenly spaced between) rather than against
a fixed target number. A fixed revenue target would have to guess the
league's total economy in advance; rank-based scoring self-calibrates
to whatever actually happens this season and treats "outperforming your
classmates" as the standard, same as the ranking component already does.

PLAYOFFS is a FLAT, BINARY bonus: full 5 points for finishing in the
top `playoff_teams` of the final regular-season standings, 0 otherwise
-- not tiered by seed, since there is no bracket to separate a 1-seed
from a 6-seed. Finishing 1st vs. 6th is already rewarded by RANKING.

Run compute_scorecards() after the season concludes, or at any
freeze-point (e.g. midterm check-in) using whatever standings/finances/
rationale data exist so far -- every component degrades gracefully to 0
for a team with no data yet.
