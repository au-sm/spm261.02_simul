"""
Records one team's NEGOTIATED Local TV Deal rate -- either a LIVE deal
(you type in exactly what two students agreed to, crediting a
commission to whoever played the network rep) or ALGORITHMIC (leverage
decides everything, no live counterpart, no commission).

This is the Local TV Deal ONLY. The League-Wide (National) TV Deal
stays fully automatic -- it is one shared league-wide split (a base
payment plus a standings/Star Power bonus applied identically to every
team), with no natural second party to negotiate against, unlike a
market-specific regional broadcast contract. See engine/negotiation.py
for the shared leverage/revenue-axis math (the exact same -10%/+10%
mechanic already used for Sponsorship Revenue) and
engine/generate_tv_negotiation_rotation.py for who negotiates with whom.

There is no brand choice here -- every team already has exactly one
Local TV Deal, fixed by its randomly assigned market tier
(data/local_tv_deals.json). But just like Sponsorship, TWO separate
things are on the table: the revenue rate AND a performance clause
(base_clause set by market tier -- see MARKET_TIERS in
generate_local_tv_deals.py). Negotiating only ever runs once per team
(re-running this for a team that already negotiated is refused).

IMPORTANT -- this does NOT pay anyone yet. Local TV money is still
paid out at the Round 3 split, same as before, with the Star Power
modifier (+15% for a top-3 starting-XI at that time) still applied on
top. All this script does is replace the flat market-tier base with
the NEGOTIATED number that the Round 3 payout step will use instead
-- exactly like a real regional broadcast contract is negotiated once,
long before the checks it generates ever get cut. Writes to
data/local_tv_deals.json, not data/team_finances.json.

LIVE MODE (the normal path for the in-class negotiation exercise):
    python3 engine/resolve_local_tv_pick.py --team 3 \\
        --live --final-revenue 935000 --final-clause standard \\
        --network-rep-team 17

  Team 3 is Mid Market ($850,000 base, standard clause), so the
  live-negotiated $935,000 rate credits an $85,000 commission to
  Team 17, whoever played the network rep in that negotiation --
  booked immediately (the commission is a reward for negotiating
  skill, not TV money itself, so it doesn't wait for the Round 3
  split).

  The mirror case is rewarded too: if the rep instead talks the team
  down BELOW base (a good deal for the network), the same size
  commission -- the savings, base minus final_revenue -- is credited
  to the rep's team instead, same immediate booking. Either direction
  requires --network-rep-team (only an exact match to base needs no
  rep). Never a deduction from the negotiating team's own rate --
  always additive, on top of whatever they locked in, in both
  directions. --final-clause is required alongside --final-revenue,
  same as Sponsorship's --live mode.

ALGORITHMIC MODE (practice / fallback if a team never got a live
negotiation -- no human played network rep, so no commission applies):
    python3 engine/resolve_local_tv_pick.py --team 3 --take-base
    python3 engine/resolve_local_tv_pick.py --team 3 --negotiate \\
        --negotiate-clause --clause-intensity bold
