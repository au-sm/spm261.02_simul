"""
Records one team's sponsorship pick -- either resolved algorithmically
(leverage decides everything, no live counterpart) or as a LIVE deal
(you type in exactly what two students actually agreed to, and credit
a commission to whoever played the sponsor rep).

LIVE MODE (the normal path for the in-class negotiation exercise):
    python3 engine/resolve_sponsorship_pick.py --team 3 --brand "Nike" \\
        --live --final-revenue 3800000 --final-clause standard \\
        --sponsor-rep-team 17

  This records $3.8M for Team 3 (Nike lists at $3.5M base, so the
  $300,000 overage is ALSO credited as commission revenue to Team 17,
  whoever played the Nike rep in that negotiation) -- a good deal for
  the TEAM, rewarded for the rep closing a bigger deal.

  The mirror case is rewarded too: if the rep instead talks the team
  down BELOW base (a good deal for the SPONSOR), the same size
  commission -- the savings, base minus final_revenue -- is credited
  to the rep's team instead. Either direction requires
  --sponsor-rep-team (only an exact match to base needs no rep, since
  nobody negotiated anything). The commission is never a deduction
  from the signing team's own booked revenue -- always additive, on
  top of whatever they recorded, in both directions.

ALGORITHMIC MODE (practice / fallback for a category that never got a
live negotiation -- no human played sponsor, so no commission applies):
    python3 engine/resolve_sponsorship_pick.py --team 3 --brand "Nike" \\
        --take-base
    python3 engine/resolve_sponsorship_pick.py --team 3 --brand "Nike" \\
        --negotiate --negotiate-clause --clause-intensity bold

RULES ENFORCED HERE (see engine/negotiation.py for the full system):
  - A team may hold AT MOST ONE brand per category.
  - A brand's qty is a LEAGUE-WIDE cap on how many teams total may hold
    it -- multiple teams sharing a brand is expected, not a bug.
  - Sponsors PAY teams. There is no cost check because there is no cost.
