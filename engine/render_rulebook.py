      <p><strong>Sponsors pay you</strong> &mdash; there is no cost to sign anything, matching how real sponsorship deals
      work. Brands are grouped into {n_categories} categories (real clubs carry exactly one jersey sponsor, one kit
      manufacturer, one official airline &mdash; not an unlimited pile of deals), and every team MUST sign
      <strong>exactly one brand per category</strong> before the draft ends &mdash; this is mandatory, not optional.
      Multiple teams may hold the same brand (Nike sponsors many real clubs at once); the "slots" number on each brand is
      a league-wide cap, not an exclusivity lock.</p>
      <p>On your turn (same turn-order format as the player draft, cycling through all {n_categories} categories), target
      an open brand in whichever category you're filling. Two separate things are on the table:</p>
      <h3>Revenue</h3>
      <p>Take the listed Base revenue exactly (guaranteed, zero risk), or Negotiate. Negotiating lands you anywhere from
      <strong>&minus;10% to +10%</strong> of the brand's base revenue, set by your <strong>Negotiating Leverage</strong>
      (built from your roster's average Star Power, plus a standings bonus once the season starts): leverage 0 lands at
      &minus;10%, leverage 50 lands exactly at base, leverage 100 lands at +10%. Negotiating is not risk-free the way
      taking Base is &mdash; a weak hand can genuinely land below base.</p>
      <p><strong>The commission:</strong> whenever a negotiated deal lands away from base &mdash; in EITHER direction
      &mdash; that gap is ALSO credited as bonus revenue to whichever team's student played the sponsor rep in that
      negotiation. Land above base (good for the signing team) and the overage goes to the rep's team; talk the team
      down below base (good for the sponsor) and the savings goes to the rep's team instead. Landing exactly at base
      earns nobody a commission, since nothing was actually negotiated. Never a deduction from the signing team's own
      booked revenue either way.</p>
      <h3>Clause</h3>
      <p>A separate ask: push for a looser clause at Modest / Bold / Very Bold intensity, gated by the same leverage
      number. Ask beyond what your leverage supports and the brand walks away on the clause specifically &mdash; that
      costs you nothing on the revenue side, and you can simply not push the clause further.</p>
      {category_blocks}
      <h3>What the Clause Actually Means</h3>
      <p>The performance clause is not flavor text -- it is real revenue at risk, and each clause level sets its OWN
      rank threshold to keep the money. Checked ONCE, at the end of the season (Round {ce["checkpoint_round"]}, the final
      round): if your team's FINAL rank misses that specific deal's threshold, that deal claws back a flat
      <strong>{int(ce["penalty_pct"]*100)}%</strong> of its revenue -- the clause you negotiated sets how hard the bar is
      to clear, not how much you lose if you miss it:</p>
      <table><thead><tr><th>Clause</th><th class="num">Required final rank</th><th class="num">Penalty if missed</th></tr></thead><tbody>
        <tr><td>Strict</td><td class="num">Top {rt["strict"]}</td><td class="num">{int(ce["penalty_pct"]*100)}%</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Standard</td><td class="num">Top {rt["standard"]}</td><td class="num">{int(ce["penalty_pct"]*100)}%</td></tr>

        <tr><td>None</td><td class="num">No requirement</td><td class="num">0%, ever</td></tr>
      </tbody></table>
      <p>This is checked PER DEAL, off your one final rank -- a team can clear a loose-clause deal's easy bar while
      missing a strict-clause deal's demanding one in the exact same season, whether those deals are both sponsors or
      one is a sponsor and the other your Local TV Deal (see the TV / Broadcast Revenue section below -- Local TV
      deals carry a clause too, checked against this exact same table). A strict clause pays more up front for a real
      bet that you'll actually contend; a loose clause is the safer, lower-upside insurance policy. Checked exactly
      once, at season end -- never applied twice to the same deal.</p>

      your draft turn: see the separate Sponsorship Marketplace site.</p>'''

          <strong>It is published before that round's Weekly Lineup deadline</strong>, both on the live dashboard (each roster

            independently re-verified after the fact, same principle as every match result.</li>
            <li><strong>Live in class:</strong> the league office runs the resolution engine once, in front of everyone. At your
            turn each round, you get the highest-ranked player still on YOUR board who's still available and still fits under
            your remaining cap space &mdash; instant, no live back-and-forth required.</li>
            <li><strong>If your whole board runs out</strong> before your roster is full (bad luck &mdash; too many targets taken

            <li>The home team gets a fixed +5% Attack bonus.</li>
            <li>Attack vs. opposing Defense produces an expected-goals (xG) number for each side &mdash; a big mismatch caps
            out rather than producing an unrealistic blowout.</li>
            <li>The actual score is drawn randomly around each side's xG &mdash; the deliberate "luck" every real match has.
            A stronger team is more likely to win, never guaranteed to.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Every match's random draw is seeded from the season's fixed seed plus that exact matchup &mdash; any result can
          be independently re-verified after the fact, and nothing is adjustable after the fact by the league office.</p>'''),

          <p>As the home team, you set a ticket price tier. Attendance responds to price AND to your recent form and

            <tr><td>Premium</td><td class="num mono">$50</td><td>Highest per-ticket revenue, but demand drops sharply without form/Star Power to justify it</td></tr>
          </tbody></table>
          <p>There is no universally correct price &mdash; a struggling, low-Star-Power team pricing Premium will earn LESS

          specifically &mdash; that costs you nothing on the revenue side, and you can simply not push the clause
          further. See "What the Clause Actually Means" in the Sponsorship Deals &amp; Negotiation section above for
