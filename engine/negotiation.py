Sponsorship negotiation engine for the SM Owners League.

THE RULE SYSTEM, IN FULL:

Sponsors PAY teams -- there is no cost to sign, matching how real
sponsorship works. Every sponsor posts a BASE OFFER: a season_revenue
number and a performance clause (strict / standard / loose / none).

REVENUE is negotiated on a single, simple axis: the final deal can land
anywhere from -10% to +10% of the brand's base_revenue. There are no
Modest/Bold/Very Bold tiers on this axis anymore -- one straightforward
choice:
  "base"          Take the listed revenue exactly. Guaranteed, zero risk.
  "negotiate"     Push for more. Where you land is set by your
                  NEGOTIATING LEVERAGE (0-100, built from your roster's
                  average Star Power, plus a standings bonus once the
                  season starts):
                    adjustment = -10% + (leverage / 100) * 20%
                  leverage 0 -> -10% (worst case), 50 -> base exactly,
                  100 -> +10% (best case). A weak hand can genuinely
                  land BELOW base -- negotiating is not risk-free the
                  way taking "base" is.

THE COMMISSION (the reason playing sponsor rep isn't just charity),
LIVE MODE ONLY -- this crediting happens in resolve_sponsorship_pick.py
/ resolve_local_tv_pick.py's --live branch, not in resolve_revenue()
below (which only ever returns an above-base commission, since it's
ALGORITHMIC mode's function and algorithmic mode has no live rep to
credit anything to anyway):

Whenever a negotiated deal lands away from base -- in EITHER direction
-- that gap is ALSO credited as bonus revenue to whichever team's
student played the sponsor rep in that negotiation. Land ABOVE base
(good for the signing team) and the OVERAGE goes to the rep's team.
Land BELOW base (good for the sponsor) and the SAVINGS goes to the
rep's team instead, same size commission, mirrored direction. Landing
EXACTLY AT base earns nobody a commission, since nothing was actually
negotiated. Never a deduction from the signing team's own booked
revenue, either way -- always additive, like a real sales commission
that never goes negative.
Concretely: Nike lists at $3.5M; a deal closes at $3.8M; the signing
team records $3.8M revenue, and the student who played the Nike rep
records a $0.3M commission for THEIR OWN team. Or: the rep talks the
team down to $3.2M; the signing team records $3.2M (a worse deal for
them), and the rep's team still records a $0.3M commission -- for
having negotiated a good outcome for the sponsor.

CLAUSE remains its own, separate negotiation -- unaffected by the above.
Ask "looser_clause" at Modest/Bold/Very Bold intensity, gated by the
same leverage number against a required threshold; an unsuccessful ask
can still walk away (no clause change, no revenue change) the way it
always has. See CLAUSE_LEVELS below: strict -> standard -> loose -> none.

LEVERAGE (0-100), shared by both axes:
  leverage = clamp(0, 100, (avg_star_power - 50) * 2 + standings_bonus)
  standings_bonus = 0 before the season starts; once matches exist,
  +15 for a top-third team, +7 for middle-of-table, +0 for bottom-third.

THE MANDATORY RULE: every team must leave the Sponsorship Draft with
exactly one signed brand in every category (sponsorship_categories in
data/deals.json; the required count is
league_config.json -> sponsorship_categories_required). Multiple teams
may hold the same brand; qty on each brand is a LEAGUE-WIDE cap on how
many teams total can sign it, not an exclusivity lock.
