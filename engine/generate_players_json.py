"""
Regenerates players.json (repo root -- fetched as ../players.json by
assets/submissions.js from any one-level-deep page: Dashboard, Sponsorship,
TV) from data/players.csv -- includes team_id (null until drafted) so the
Weekly Lineup form can filter to a team's actual roster, and the Draft
Board form can exclude already-drafted players.

Run after any draft/round resolution (team_id assignments change),
then push. engine/auto_resolve.py calls this automatically as part of
its regenerate step.

Usage:
    python3 engine/generate_players_json.py [output_path]
